			"description"=>"Thu 16 Oct 4pm-6pmFri 17 Oct 4pm-6pm An art tutorial on how to draw a wave by surfing artist Alexander Lee. Observing and drawing the wave in the ocean with its movement and interaction between light and shadow, can be taken into all aspects of drawing. Whether it is life drawing, still life, landscape or city scape. Light and shadow help project perspective into our minds, not only in realism but also the naive. How do we transfer colour into grey scale, for instance drawing a blue sky in grey. To know waves is to also know how leaves fall or how clouds form. The mechanics of waves helps us imagine the movement of anything without seeing it. We can place emotion into art. Turner has many examples of waves and it is a great English tradition in art, with England possessing one of the greatest coastlines in the world, it is an amazing resource. Alexander Lee was born in 1975 in Blackburn, England. With his background in Fine Art he studied at the School of Fine Art Claremont in Perth, Western Australia. His detailed pencil drawings and paintings have been widely exhibited and his work sold internationally in Sweden, Norway, Australia, England, Hong Kong, Germany and Austria. www.alexanderlee.artspan.com",

Opened in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway and absorbed into the London &amp; North Eastern Railway in 1923, the line became part of London Transport’s Underground network in 1949. The last tube train ran on the line in 1994 and a team of volunteers has since worked hard to re-open the line as a heritage attraction. Our journey starts on a vintage bus that takes us to the station at North Weald, the mid-point on the railway. From there the railway runs two services: by diesel train to Coopersale and back; and by steam train to Ongar and back. On the train you will step back in time and experience the romance of travel in bygone days while passing through picturesque countryside, beautiful forest and historic towns. Your ticket is valid all day, so you can simply travel backwards and forwards on the trains (or buses) if you wish - you could squeeze in four or five trips up and down the line during the time we’ll be there - or you can get off at the two stations, soak up the atmosphere, and explore North Weald and Ongar and the surrounding countryside. Remember to bring your camera as there should be many photo opportunities during the day. An additional attraction that we'll be visiting at North Weald is the small North Weald Airfield Museum, ten minutes’ walk from the station. For more information, see the railway’s website and the airfield museum's website. Refreshments We can patronize the railway’s café coach at North Weald, which serves a range of hot and cold drinks and light refreshments, or bring your own lunch to eat at one of the several picnic tables around the site. There is also the ‘Buffet Stop’ at Ongar station, which sells hot and cold drinks, crisps and snacks. Ongar has a picnic and viewing area with a grandstand view of the station and locomotives. Prices Tickets for the railway cost £13 for adults (£11 concessions) and allow you unlimited travel all day long on the railway’s steam and diesel trains, and vintage buses. We’ll buy our tickets on the vintage bus as we travel to North Weald. Tickets for the North Weald Airfield Museum cost £2 for adults (£1.50 concessions). Directions Epping station is at the extreme eastern end of the Central line, in Zone 6. If you need a lift to Epping please put a message on the meetup board.

About the play The first run of Marlowe’s brutal and incendiary masterpiece to be staged in England in 400 years returns to the Rose – the site of its very first performance in 1593 – after its sell-out success earlier this year. Marlowe’s last play retells twenty years of the French Wars of Religion at breakneck speed, from the cold planning of mass murder, through the shocking events of the notorious 1572 St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, to the poisoning of Charles IX, and the coronation and subsequent assassination of his flamboyant, homosexual brother Henry III. The play’s anti-hero, the villainous Duke of Guise, proves the ultimate Marlovian over-reacher. About the theatre The Rose was built in 1587 by Philip Henslowe and by a grocer named John Cholmley. It was the first purpose-built playhouse to ever stage a production of any of Shakespeare's plays.  It survived until about 1601, when it's lease ended and wasn't renewed by Henslowe.  In 1989, the remains of the Rose were found and it's now an archaeological site and theatre run by volunteers.  The Rose is associated with the playwright; Christopher Marlowe and many of his plays were put on here.  Marlowe was a contemporary of Shakespeare, he was born in the same year, but met a sad end in 1593 when he was killed in a tavern brawl in Deptford. If you have never been to the theatre before, it is very small, with only about 50 seats.  Tickets are £12 each and you can book here...  (for students, OAP's and residents of Southwark, it is only £10).  Alternatively, you can pop by and purchase a ticket on the door.The play starts at 7:30pm and lasts about 1 hour 30mins.  The theatre has no heating, so wear extra clothing.  It also doesn't have any toilets. Lookout for 'Cultureseekers' signs in the coffee shop (we normally gather over to the right of the coffee shop as you go in), if you can't see us, give me a call or text. Hope to see you there.
